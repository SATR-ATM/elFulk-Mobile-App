# Git & GitHub Guide (Open Source)

This document defines the **default workflow for contributing to this repository** using:
- **GitHub Issues** (work starts with an issue)
- **GitHub Projects** (issues/PRs are tracked on the project board)
- **Forks + Pull Requests** (standard open-source contribution model)

---

## Non‑negotiable rules

1) **`main` is the default branch** (protected)
   - ✅ Changes land via Pull Request (PR)
   - ❌ No direct pushes, no direct merges to `main`

2) **Work starts from an Issue**
   - Create an issue (or pick an existing one)
   - Get it **triaged and assigned** before doing significant work (avoids duplicates)

3) **All work happens on short‑lived branches** in your fork (or in the upstream repo if you’re a maintainer).

4) **Every PR must link to an Issue and be added to the GitHub Project board.**

5) After merge: **delete the branch** (remote + local).

6) **Firebase production config must never be committed**
   - ✅ Commit only development Firebase files
   - ❌ Do not commit production Firebase files (`google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`, `firebase_options_production.dart`)
   - See `docs/firebase-open-source.md`

---

## 1) Issues + GitHub Projects (how work is organized)

### 1.1 Start with an Issue (required)
- Bug fix → open an issue describing **steps to reproduce**, expected vs actual, logs/screenshots.
- Feature → open an issue describing **problem**, proposed solution, scope, and acceptance criteria.

✅ Good practice:
- Comment on the issue to claim it.
- Wait for a maintainer to **assign** you (or explicitly approve you to proceed).

> **Note:** For very small changes (typos, formatting, minor docs fixes), some open-source projects accept a PR without an issue. In this project, we prefer opening an issue first for consistent tracking—use your judgment for truly trivial edits.

### 1.2 Add to GitHub Projects (required)
Every tracked piece of work must be in the project board:
- Add the **Issue** to the Project
- Add the **PR** to the same Project

> Tip: On GitHub, open the Issue/PR → right sidebar → **Projects** → select the project.

---

## 2) Branches and naming

### 2.1 Branch naming (required)
Use the GitHub issue number instead of a ClickUp ID.

```
<type>/<issue-number>-<short-kebab-description>
```

**Allowed types**
- `feature/` → new functionality
- `fix/` → bug fix
- `hotfix/` → urgent fix (maintainers only, if needed)
- `refactor/` → refactor without behavior change
- `chore/` → housekeeping (deps, tooling)
- `docs/` → documentation
- `ci/` → CI / pipelines

**Examples**
- `feature/123-profile-avatar-upload`
- `fix/245-login-crash-null-token`
- `refactor/88-api-layer-cleanup`
- `docs/12-update-contributing`

---

## 3) Open‑source contribution flow (fork → PR)

### 3.1 Create / pick an Issue
1) Open or select an Issue (must exist).
2) Get assigned (or get explicit maintainer approval).
3) Make sure the Issue is in the GitHub Project board.

### 3.2 Fork and clone
1) Fork the repo on GitHub.
2) Clone **your fork** locally:
```bash
git clone <your-fork-url>
cd <repo>
```

3) Add the upstream remote (the original repo):
```bash
git remote add upstream <upstream-repo-url>
git remote -v
```

### 3.3 Create a branch from upstream `main`
Always branch from the latest upstream `main`:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git switch main
git reset --hard upstream/main
git switch -c feature/123-profile-avatar-upload
```

> Alternative (if you prefer):
> `git pull --rebase upstream main` instead of `reset --hard` (just keep it clean).

### 3.4 Commit rules (emoji is mandatory)

**Commit format (required)**
```
<emoji> <type>(scope): short description
```

**Examples**
- `✨ feat(profile): add avatar upload`
- `🐛 fix(auth): prevent crash on empty token`
- `🧹 refactor(api): simplify error mapping`
- `📝 docs(readme): update setup instructions`
- `🚀 ci(github): speed up cache strategy`

**Emoji mapping**
- ✨ feature
- 🐛 bug fix
- ❌ breaking change
- 🧹 refactor / cleanup
- 🏗️ build config
- 📝 documentation
- 🗑️ chore / remove
- 🧪 tests
- 🚀 CI / pipeline

✅ Keep commits small and reviewable:
```bash
git add -p
git commit -m "✨ feat(profile): add avatar picker UI"
```

### 3.5 Push to your fork
```bash
git push -u origin feature/123-profile-avatar-upload
```

### 3.6 Open a Pull Request (PR) to upstream `main`
- Base: `main` (upstream repo)
- Compare: your fork branch
- Fill the PR template (below)
- Ensure CI passes

✅ Recommended merge method (maintainers):
- **Squash & merge** (keeps history clean)

### 3.7 Link the PR to the Issue (required)
In the PR description, include one of:
- `Closes #123`
- `Fixes #123`
- `Resolves #123`

This will auto-close the issue when the PR is merged.

### 3.8 Keep your PR up to date
If upstream `main` moved, update your branch:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
git push --force-with-lease
```

> `--force-with-lease` is safer than `--force`.

### 3.9 After merge: cleanup
On GitHub: click **Delete branch** (if available)

Locally:
```bash
git switch main
git branch -d feature/123-profile-avatar-upload
```

Remote (your fork):
```bash
git push origin --delete feature/123-profile-avatar-upload
```

---

## 4) Maintainer flow (no fork)

If you have write access to the upstream repo:
- You may create branches directly in the upstream repo **or** use a fork (both are fine).
- You still must:
  - Work on a short‑lived branch
  - Open a PR to `main`
  - Link the Issue
  - Add Issue + PR to the GitHub Project board

---

## 5) PR template (MANDATORY)
